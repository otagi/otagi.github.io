I'm a web developer who writes code in Ruby, opinions in English, and personal thoughts in French.

As an adept of asynchronous collaborative workflows, agile methods, and clean, beautiful code, I like to work with people who share these values.

When I'm away from pixels, I'm riding my bicycle, or sailing in salty waters.

Let's [work together](mailto:hello@mendes-costa.net) on your next Ruby on Rails project!
