# What I'm doing now

I'm currently in Brussels, enjoying its chilly winter life.

My main focus is my day job at [MyMicroInvest](https://www.mymicroinvest.com), writing Ruby on Rails code with a fantastic team.

I'm also a [Ruby Belgium](http://www.rubybelgium.be) board member, and current organizer of the monthly [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/ruby_belgium/) in Brussels.
