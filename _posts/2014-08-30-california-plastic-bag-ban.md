title: California Plastic Bag Ban
---

California just voted the state-wide ban of single-use plastic bags in retail stores. [The Sacramento Bee][bee] has a good summary of the situation.

The new bill will officialize what major Californian cities already enforce: free plastic bags in shops replaced by 10-cent reusable ones. This is essentially what the supermarkets are doing here in Brussels. No massive jobs losses, no burden for the stores, no grouchy customers. And a major positive impact on people’s minds.

The paper quotes [Neel Kashkari][neel], opponent of the current governor:

> Poverty? Jobs? Education? Rebuilding the middle class? Nope. Plastic bags. #embarrassing

I know it’s his job to say anything to contradict the adversary. But it’s a good example of short vs. long-term vision: it’s not just plastic bags. It’s an economic and health issue. Plastic goes into the ocean, and either kills or contaminates the fauna. In the best case scenario, the fishing industry will make  less money and hospitals will have to deal with pathologies related to toxic chemicals in fishes. I’ll let you imagine the worst case scenario.
