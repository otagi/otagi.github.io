# Alien Twitter 

A mashup experiment for funsies. Published as a farewell tweet after the platform cut access to third-party clients on 13/01/2023. 

> Final report on the commercial shitshow Twitter, third officer reporting. The other members of the crew - Tweetbot, Twitterrific, Echofon, Plume, and others - are dead. API and goodwill destroyed. I should reach the fediverse in about six weeks. With a little luck, the network will pick me up. This is Ripley, last survivor of the Twittosphere, signing off.
