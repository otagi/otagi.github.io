Guy English has an interesting take on the new Mac Pro:

> The CPU is a front end to a couple of very capable massively parallel processors at the end of a relatively fast bus. One of those GPUs isn’t even hooked up to do graphics. I think that’s a serious tell.

I wondered why Apple only announced a single-CPU configuration for such a number-crunching beast. It's obvious now: they didn't. This Mac actually comes with a double CPU[^1], where one of them happens to be fully optimized for parallel computing tasks.

A clever and bold design decision.

[^1]: Or triple CPU, depending on your graphics needs.
